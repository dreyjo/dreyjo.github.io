          <h2> Graduate Portfolio </h2>
          <p>On this page you will find three projects I selected for inclusion in my Portfolio as a completion requirement for the MS. In Library and Information Science at Pratt School of Information. These projects demonstrate my commitment to:
            examining the ways continuing histories of power shape how data is understood, used and made available and to challenging notions of political neutrality in librarianship.</p>

          <p><b>Class:</b> INFO 601 Foundations of Information<br>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">"Cloud as Ground", image by Drey Jonathan</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p><b>Project Description:</b> In this research paper I examined the natural resource metaphors used in conversations around data. Using “Data is the new oil” as a point of departure I proposed that the use of natural resource metaphors
            were on the one hand a way of making material, or <em>grounding</em>, the ephemeral nature of data while also obscuring the many ways data is always already material. I positioned the narrative around “natural resources” as a contaminated
            metaphor, hiding within itself the historic and continuing violence against Black, Brown, and Indigenous peoples, exploitative labor, land dispossession, and colonialism as necessary mechanisms of resource extraction.</p>
          <p><b>Methods:</b> My primary method of research was conducting a literature review of scholarly and popular writing on cultural and economic understandings of data from different disciplines including information science and studies,
            critical data studies, science and technology studies, art history and Black Feminist Thought.</p>
          <p><b>My Role:</b> I am the sole author of this project</p>
          <p><b>Learning Outcome Achieved:</b> Foundations of Library and Information Science</p>
          <p><b>Rationale:</b> In this paper I demonstrated my ability to describe and examine the social, economic and political dimensions of information, core concepts to consider in the design of access and approach to information environments,
            particularly in the context of an increasingly data-centric world I will be working in as an information professional.</p>
          <p><b>Learning Outcome Achieved:</b> Ethical, Creative, and Critical Practice</p>
          <p><b>Rationale:</b> Librarians, archivists, and information professionals more generally are not only stewards of information but active participants in global information environments; we not only collect and describe knowledge but are
            also critical makers of knowledge in our own right. In this paper I demonstrated my desire to develop a personal librarianship practice as committed to examining the way power operates in information ecosystems as it is to navigating and
            guiding community members through said information ecosystems.</p>

          <p><b>Class:</b> INFO 652 Reference and Instruction<br>
            <b>Professor:</b> Shawn Smith-Cruz

            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Screenshot from Black Anarchism Libguide featuring Lucy Parsons</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p><b>Project Description:</b> The Black Anarchism LibGuide was created to collect literature, essential texts, and audiovisual resources to assist visitors, and in particular Black visitors, in learning about alternative political
            formations. The LibGuide was designed to draw attention to the relationship between Anarchism and histories of the Black Radical Tradition; the continuing struggle for Black autonomy and liberation. The Libguide highlights that there have
            always been Black people within traditional understandings of Anarchist politics while also seeing the ways that many manifestations of the Black Radical Tradition, from the Black Panther Party and the Combahee River Collective to mutual
            aid networks today being developed in response to the racialized impacts of COVID-19 are practicing anarchist politics because they center communal power over state or institutional power. The movements, theory, and practices in the guide
            are acts of survival within and modes of imagining structures outside of inherently anti-Black and heterosexist capitalism. Feedback on the core usefulness of the guide included appreciation for the in-depth description of resources
            included and the variety of resources assembled.
          <p>
          <p><b>Methods:</b> Creating this Libguide was a group effort, researched and built by myself, Claire Mooney, Avery Jonas, and Sadie Hope-Gund. Which began with group brainstorming on ideas. We initially split tactics, having two members
            collect resources on one possible topic and the remaining two do the same on another. In looking at the resources we collected, sources on Black Queer Identity and Film from the African Continent (a topic idea suggested by Avery Jonas)
            and Black Anarchism (a topic idea originally suggested by group member, Sadie Hope-Gund). The group collectively discussed our individual feelings on the preliminary sources and decided that Black Anarchism would provide a larger frame
            for research and space to include sources we’d found for our other possible topics. With a topic chosen we conducted research to collect texts, multimedia, and links from a variety of sources including other LibGuides, anarchist zine
            collections and news sites, political historians, activist writing and scholarly databases. We collected these resources into a shared Zotero library. An important set of tools used in thinking about how our sources would be structured
            were the ACRL Frameworks for Information Literacy, In particular “Scholarship as Conversation” and “Research as Strategic Exploration”. As a group we used the frameworks to think through how information would be ordered and structured
            within the guide.
          <p>
          <p><b>My Role:</b> My direct role in the project was responsibility for the Home Page, where I explained the group’s rationale for this topic, defined how we understood Black Identity and Anarchism in the context of Black Anarchism, and
            summarized the content of the guide. I understood my role within the project as facilitating framing of our subject matter, drawing from theory and history sources in our research to provide a simple explanation of what this guide was and
            why it might be useful to a visitor. This was a similar role to the one I played in planning discussions where I worked to synthesize and clarify our ideas and approaches.
          <p>
          <p><b>Learning Outcome Achieved:</b> User-Centered Services
          <p>
          <p><b>Rationale:</b> In this project I demonstrated my ability to understand and center the needs of a particular and marginalized community; fellow Black people, seeking information on alternative politics and society structures outside of
            anti-black capitalism, and design an information service centering those needs and providing resources in visual, audio and written formats.
          <p>
          <p><b>Learning Outcome Achieved:</b> Research
          <p>
          <p><b>Rationale:</b> In this project I investigated the information environments of libguides focused on histories of Black activism and the Black Radical Tradition in order to collect modes of designing and orienting users on libguide
            focused on political histories, this investigation was essential to thinking about user experience in our libguide project.

          <p><b>Project Description:</b> Fair Is was a research project begun in INFO 656: Machine Learning and continued in INFO 640 Data Analysis. I became interested in the use of fairness as a metric in the design of remedies to algorithmic harm.
            While machine learning distributes harm along multiple and intersecting axis of power relations and identity (i.e race, gender identity, economic standing, to name a few examples) the nuances of these social dynamics is discussed in
            scholarly and popular literature through the lens of “bias” to which fairness is offered as a remedy. How do we balance the necessary flattening that is needed to structure data, while also understanding that “bias” involves larger forces
            that may be impossible to subvert solely within model building? Is “fairness” just about parity of representation within a dataset? This project sought to examine the different understanding of “fairness” machine learning practitioners
            were utilizing as a way of bringing to light the underlying assumptions and limits of “bias” within these conversations.
          <p>
          <p><b>Methods:</b>In the first iteration of this work I downloaded a metadata snapshot dataset of the pre-print (meaning pre peer-review) repository, arxiv, maintained by Cornell University. I then used the python library, pandas, to create
            a dataset of abstracts for papers that were “about fairness” and used the arxiv subject tags cs_AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs_ML (Machine Learning). I defined “about fairness” as papers that had the word “fair” in the title. Once I
            had a dataset of text data, otherwise known as a corpus, to work with I then sought to use topic modeling to identify different groupings of related documents within my dataset. Topic Modeling is a statistical technique for grouping
            documents based on some number of related words, known as the k value. I used one mode of topic modeling called Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or LDA. LDA is an unsupervised machine learning model which takes a k-value as input, read a
            document as some distribution of topics, and a topic as some distribution of words. I fit my LDA model, using the gensim python package, to my dataset and then iterated on a k-value number of topics to attempt to sort abstracts into while
            adjusting for clarity and interpreting strands of thought.<br>In the second iteration of this project I used python to scrape the Proceeding Papers metadata for the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency Conference for 2018 - 2020
            from the ACM Digital Library. I used a combination of python and R to clean, structure, pre-process and again fit an LDA model to my new dataset.

          <p><b>Learning Outcome Achieved:</b> Technology
          <p>
          <p><b>Rationale:</b> In this project I demonstrated my ability to research and learn new technologies and digital processes. In deciding I was interested in uncovering subjects and understandings I selected machine assisted topic modeling
            as a useful tool. I then expanded my knowledge of python programming language in order to apply Topic Modeling and Latent Dirichlet Allocation to my research problem
