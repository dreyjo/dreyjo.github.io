        <p>I'm Andreas (Drey) Jonathan, I use they/them pronouns and i'm a Master of Science in Library and Information Science candidate at Pratt institute School of Infromation, graduating February 2021.<br>

Prior to starting the MSLIS, I received a BA. in Architectural Studies from Ithaca College where I focused on social and political relationships as architectures in their own right.<br>

I come to librarianship as a Black, Queer, Non-binary and first-generation Ghanaian/Nigerian American, interested in critical librarianship practices, the politics of fairness and inclusion in algorithmic decision systems and artificial intelligence. I think a lot about how the ways we think about data and data-centric technologies influence how we approach them, regulate them and what kinds of relationships we build with and through them. Iâ€™m interested in working at the intersections of data librarianship and curation, digital humanities, digital preservation and code in service of community care, education, and empowerment.</p>

<!-- Next Steps:
- use php to create an include of this template for each page so I don't have to do this again?
- bring in bootstrap
- use bootstrap to set up grids
- bring in for my name (Roboto works for the body text I think)
- bring in a color for text (Remember we want a light/bright grey)
- need some kind of contrast color or patter somewhere (let's think about that)-->
