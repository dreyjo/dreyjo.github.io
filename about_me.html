    <h2> Hello World(s)!</h2>
    <p> I'm Andreas (Drey) Jonathan and i'm a
      Master of Sciecne in Library and Information Science candidate
      at Pratt institute School of Infromation, graduating February 2021.</p>

    <p>I come to librarianship as a Black, Queer, Non-binary and first-generation American,
      by way of Ghana and Nigeria interested in critical librarianship practices,
      the politics of fairness and inclusion in algorithmic decision systems and artificial intelligence.
      I think a lot about how the ways we think about data and data-centric technologies
      influence how we approach them, regulate them and what kinds of relationships
      we build with and through them.</p>

<!-- Next Steps:
- use php to create an include of this template for each page so I don't have to do this again?
- bring in bootstrap
- use bootstrap to set up grids
- bring in for my name (Roboto works for the body text I think)
- bring in a color for text (Remember we want a light/bright grey)
- need some kind of contrast color or patter somewhere (let's think about that)-->
